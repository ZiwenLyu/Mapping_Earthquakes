# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Project Overview 
This project is to use leaflet and mapbox to display the earthquake frequency around the world on an interactive map. The data source is from earthquake.usgs.gov. The folder Earthquake_Challenge/ contains the index page and the code to illustrate the map. The following result is shown in the figure:

As you can see, the color and the size of circles indicate the magnitudes of earthquakes in various locations, and the blue lines are the tectonic plates. The legend is at the right bottom. The control of map styles and layers are at the right top. There are three styles of maps to choose: streets, dark, and satellite. And three layers of data for visitors to check: all earthquakes, major earthquakes, and tectonic plates.

Also, the visitor can click each circle to see pop-up messsages with detailed information of the magnitude and the location of the earthquake.
